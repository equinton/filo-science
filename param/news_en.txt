- Users with param permission can create and execute SQL queries directly in the database.

Version 1.4.0 of 2019-12-17

- addition of the table sequence_point, to manage inventories by collection points
- addition of the geom attribute on the operation and ambience tables to facilitate cartographic representation with third party software
- a business code can be indicated for an installed machine
- it is now possible to duplicate an operation, at least the general information
- the last processed campaign can now be recalled from the menu
- in the detail of an operation, the location of the sequences is displayed on a map

Bug fixes:
- entering the total weight of a sample did not support decimals
- the display of the database table structure has been improved to facilitate its reading
- importing files in Json format failed in some cases

Release 1.3.0 of 2019-11-18
---------------------------
News:
- integration of the radiotracking management module: fish monitoring, definition of listening stations or physico-chemical analysis, field entry from QField (Android component for Qgis), display of movements on a map
- integration of modules allowing the import of probe data or listening stations and data exchange between two databases
- addition of the UUID to safely identify the different records managed by the fishing module
- caching of OpenStreetMap tiles to be able to work in offline mode

Release 1.2.0 of 2019-08-29
---------------------------
Bug fixes:
- it was not possible to enter the total weight of the batch
- the map display now works without resizing the window

News :
- the batch number is now displayed when entering fish
- when there is a taxon change, an alert signal is displayed
- the tabs are displayed when hovering (a click on a tab disables this mechanism). The last tab used is displayed by default
- it is possible to add parts to a project, protocol or operation
- it is possible to define a grid of buttons, which allows to quickly select the most frequent taxa
- it is possible to define specific analyses associated with a protocol
- it is possible to define complementary measures for a taxon, associated with a protocol
- campaigns are now systematically displayed in relation to the first project in the list. Projects can be positioned "inactive" to avoid viewing them during the search
- when capturing fish, the overflight of the current measurement fields allows to define the focus
- to allow automatic size entry from calipers, the + sign is systematically removed
- the entry by caliper leading by default to the validation of the current sheet and the creation of a new fish sheet, a button deactivates this automatic call. You must then click on the validation buttons to save the information
- upgrading the framework to integrate current security requirements
